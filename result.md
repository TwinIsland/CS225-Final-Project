**Floyd Warshall:**

It contains the shortest path information (include path and distance) between each vertexes. below shows small part of the output. For those row with weight equal to -1, it means that there is no such path between two airport.

```
Shortest path from: SUG to PEN is: SUG -> MNL -> SIN -> PEN with weight: 0.843141
Shortest path from: SUG to IQT is: SUG ->  with weight: -1
Shortest path from: SUG to MHQ is: SUG ->  with weight: -1
Shortest path from: SUG to LYC is: SUG ->  with weight: -1
Shortest path from: SUG to HTA is: SUG ->  with weight: -1
Shortest path from: SUG to DRW is: SUG -> MNL -> SIN -> DRW with weight: 1.18898
Shortest path from: SUG to TUG is: SUG -> MNL -> TUG with weight: 0.53564
Shortest path from: SUG to PNH is: SUG -> MNL -> SIN -> PNH with weight: 0.943769
```

**Betweenness Centrality:**

the whole dataset contains 6073 rows, the complete version can be find in [bc_whole_data.csv]([/bc_whole_data.csv). below shows the top 20 biggest betweenness centrality of the data

## Correctness

We use test case to check the correctness of out algorithm

## Conclusion

Our result shows that the most centralized airport are the most famous airport worldwide and also set at the critical point of the world. From our output,  `LHR`, `LAX`, `ATL`, which stand for Heathrow Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, are the top3 airport with the biggest centrality.
